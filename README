###############################################################################


ABOUT
=====

Modifies a RHEL 8.4+ x86_64 Workstation or Server DVD with a kickstart
that will install a system that is configured and hardened for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. 

NOTE: ROOT ACCOUNT IS LOCKED WITH INSTALL USE 'admin' ACCOUNT WITH 'sudo' INSTEAD.

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects 
into a single installer:

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying a graphical classification banner)
   
        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner

   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) Content - Benchmark and hardening scripts for the 
     system after installation
   
        https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide


CONTENT
=======

createiso.sh - installation script to modify RHEL 8.4+ ISO image

/config - Kickstarts, Python, and RPMs needed to modify image.

	EFI/BOOT/
	
		grub.cfg - Menu Configuration for UEFI boot
	
	isolinux/

		isolinux.cfg - Menu Configuration for Kickstart

	hardening/

		ssg-rhel.cfg
		
			Kickstart Configuration (Calls menu.py in %pre)
		
		menu.py
		
			Python Script that presents a graphical menu to modify the
			kickstart. Contains the "Profiles" for configuring the 
			system partitioning and packages.

		classification-banner.py
		
			Graphical Classification Banner (for GNOME Desktops User/
			Developer Workstation Profiles)

		openscap*.rpm
		scap-security-guide-*.el8.noarch.rpm

			Uses OpenSCAP and the SCAP Security Guide (SSG) to test and
			remediate system.

		ssg-suplemental.sh

			Additional system lockdowns (FIPS 140-2 Kernel Mode, GNOME,
			wheel group for root access, etc.)

		rhevm-preinstall.sh
		rhevm-postinstall.sh

			Scripts to loosen settings temporarily to allow registration
			of the system with RHEV-M by allowing root login and allowing
			exec in /tmp. Run rhevm-postinstall.sh after system is added
			into RHEV-M. Copied to /root after kickstart install

		iptables.sh (use with KVM host - which prefers iptables/ebtables)

			Configures iptables firewall during kickstart installation. 
			Called in menu.py script. Firewall is configured to recommended
			ports for each product or profile. Copied to /root after kickstart
			install. FirewallD is default except for KVM systems.

		ipa-pam-configuration.sh

			Configures system for using IPA/IdM authentication by
			overwriting the pam.d configurations. Copied to /root
			after kickstart installation
			
		usbguard-*.x86_64.rpm
		
			USB guard will control what USB devices are accessible by the system.

HARDENING INFORMATION
=====================

Here is some additional information added by the supplemental hardening script
in addition to the SSG:

1. The kernel option for  FIPS 140-2 mode is contained on the kickstart menu

2. Shell timeout (bash/csh) is 15 minutes of inactivity, vlock will lock CLI
   console

3. The 'wheel' group is required for privileged users (beyond root) to run 
   `su -` or `sudo -i` commands, sudo timeout is 5 minutes

4. The 'sshusers' group is required for SSH/SFTP access, other users are 
   limited to console access without this group
   
5. Additional Software such as McAfee EPo/HBSS may be required meet site 
   policy
   
6. Configure PTP or NTP for time synchronization (/etc/chrony.conf or /etc/ntp.conf)

7. Configure rsyslog to send logs to a centralized log monitoring. (/etc/rsyslog.conf)

8. Create users:

	NOTE: The root user is locked now - use 'admin' user account with sudo instead of root.

        Local Console Access Only (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Local User" localuser
               
        Remote Access (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Remote User" -G sshusers remoteuser
               
        System Administrator (SA) (Privileged User)
               
               # useradd -m -c "System Administrator" -G sshusers,wheel admin
               

9. Wireless  is disabled in a number of ways with Network Manager including:

	a.) `nmcli radio all off` command in /etc/rc.local
	b.) Dconf configurations to disable the creation of wireless networks:
	
		/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-gnome-hardening
			[org.gnome.nm-applet]
			disable-wifi-create=true

		/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/99-gnome-hardening
			/org/gnome/nm-applet/disable-wifi-create
	
		/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/99_custom_settings.gschema.override
			[org.gnome.nm-applet]
			disable-wifi-create=true

   Generally, wireless should not be used on a DoD/IC system.
